<h2>Car Insurance Application</h2>
<p>This car insurance application project is a Web Application that will have you input your information and then will calculate a quote for you based on your age,
  car model, car year, how many speeding tickets you may have, or if you have had a DUI.</p>
  
<h2>Shipping Quote</h2>
<p>This shipping quote console application will ask you simple questions about the size and weight of your package and will return you a quote of your shipping cost based on your inputs.</p>
